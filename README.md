ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! Iâ€™m Jason Raether. I am a Master of Science in Computer Science (with Thesis) student at Texas A&M University. I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am currently a researcher at the HUBBS Lab at TAMU, where I focus on affective computing, biofeedback devices, and machine learning. We're seeking to create technology-driven solutions for alleviating public speaking anxiety. 

I have experience in a wide variety of domains, but I'm mainly interested in building scalable artificial intelligence systems that interface with human users via speech, video, or other bio-behavioral signals. I have experience working with these multi-modal systems in my research at TAMU, and I've tackled some of the problems of working with big data and large-scale problems with Amazon Alexa Shopping NLU.
